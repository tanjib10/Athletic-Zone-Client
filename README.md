Five Features of this project:

User Role Management:

The dashboard appears to differentiate between administrators and regular users. Ensure robust user role management, allowing administrators access to specific features such as managing trainers, subscribers, forums, etc., while regular users might have access to features like activity logs, profile settings, and recommended classes.
Content Management:

The dashboard seems to have functionality related to trainers, subscribers, forums, classes, and applied trainers. Implement features that allow administrators to manage and organize this content effectively. This could include CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for trainers, subscribers, forums, classes, and applications from trainers.
Responsive Design:

The dashboard should be responsive, ensuring a seamless user experience across various devices and screen sizes. Users should be able to access and use the dashboard from desktops, tablets, and mobile devices without losing functionality or visual appeal.
Activity Logging:

For non-admin users, there is an "Activity Log" feature. Implement a comprehensive activity logging system to track user actions and system events. This can help users keep track of their interactions within the application and administrators to monitor activities across the platform.
Integration with Forums:

If the dashboard includes a feature to add new forums, ensure that there is a robust forum system in place. Users should be able to create, view, and participate in discussions. Consider implementing features like thread creation, commenting, and moderation tools.
